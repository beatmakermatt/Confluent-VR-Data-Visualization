# Confluent-VR-Data-Visualization

AI-Powered Real-Time Data Visualization in Vision Pro

#Overview
This project is an AI-powered VR data visualization app that leverages Confluent Cloud and Kafka to stream real-time data (e.g., stock market data) into an immersive VR environment using Apple Vision Pro. Users can interact with real-time data visualizations, ask an AI assistant for insights, and collaborate with others in a shared virtual space.

Use Case
Our application is designed for industries that rely on real-time data and collaborative decision-making—such as finance, healthcare, and logistics. Through scene sharing in Vision Pro, multiple users can explore the same datasets, making it a powerful tool for virtual meetings and data-driven discussions.

Key Features
Real-Time Data Streaming: Data streams are powered by Confluent Cloud using Kafka connectors to ingest and process data.
AI-Powered Insights: The AI assistant retrieves data from Kafka topics using Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) to generate dynamic insights in response to user queries.

3D Data Visualization in Vision Pro: Users can visualize live data (e.g., stock market data) in an immersive 3D environment using SceneKit.
Collaborative Scene Sharing: Multiple users can join the same virtual room, view real-time data streams, and interact with each other’s annotations and insights.

Technology Stack
Confluent Cloud & Kafka: Ingest, process, and govern real-time data streams.
SwiftUI & SceneKit: Used for building the immersive 3D data visualizations and user interface.
AI with Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG): Powers the AI assistant, allowing users to ask questions and get real-time insights based on the data streams.
Vision Pro Scene Sharing: Enables multi-user collaboration in a shared virtual environment.

Current Status
Real-time stock market data is being generated using Confluent’s Datagen connector as a placeholder for external data sources.
Stream processing is managed via Kafka Streams and ksqlDB to aggregate and filter data.
Integration with Vision Pro is underway, where users will be able to visualize this data in 3D.

Next Steps
Data integration with external APIs: Replace the Datagen source with real stock market APIs.
Expand AI capabilities: Improve the AI assistant’s ability to generate deeper insights based on real-time data.
Further development for real-time collaboration: Implement scene-sharing for multi-user environments.
